## Description
Please run *fingertipsScript* in MATLAB to build the model.

The main output of the script is a file called 'model.dat' which 
contains the RBF centers and weights, as well as the eigen texture filenames. 
Additionally, the eigen textures are saved as TIFF files.

The script also generates some plots for cross validation and comparision of 
synthesized textures to ground truth images.
