function [z phi]=sim_rbf(Xc,X,W,k_i,basisfunction)
%simulates a radial basis function
%Xc is a N_r by N_dim matrix of rbf centres
%X is a N_p by N_dim matrix of the points to simulate
%W is the weight vector
%basisfunction may be 'gaussian' or 'polyharmonicspline'
%k_i is a prescaler for 'gaussian' rbf and function order for
%'polyharmonicspline'. See k_i(i)=0 for constant bias
